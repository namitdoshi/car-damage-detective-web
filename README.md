### Assessing Car Damage with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Detecting the regions where a car has been damaged and the extent to which it has been damaged is a very interesting problem. It has potential applications in automatic auto insurance claims. 


In used car industry(both marketplace and brick and mortar dealers), apart from carâ€™s functionality and equipment availability and healthiness, which only can be accessed by test drive/manual inspection, car body external damages(scratch, dent, repaint etc.) play a vital role to decide accurate pricing of the vehicle. In most of the cases, these damages are detected and assessed manually from the car images during the car evaluation process. However, the latest computer vision frameworks can detect the damage location on the car body and help pricers to quantify the damage without much manual intervention. This concept will also help car insurers in assessing the damage automatically and in processing claim faster.
